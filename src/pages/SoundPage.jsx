        Sound Design matters. It is what connects your audience to your product. Whether it is
        designing the dings and whistles on your app, getting the right sounds for your game-scape,
        sound is what brings your audience into your creation and connects them to it. Whatever your
        needs, we can help! Hard effect, soft effect, foley and soundscaping for Film, Television,
        and Games. Branded Sound Icons for a project or company. Interactive projects ranging from
        audio navigation for the blind to the aesthetics of your user interface are welcome.
